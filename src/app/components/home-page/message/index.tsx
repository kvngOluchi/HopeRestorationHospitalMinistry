          Priest of ours understands our weakness for he lived and faced all the
          temptations we, yet he did not sin. But He was beaten that we might
          have peace. He was whipped, and we were healed! He was ooppressed and
          treated harshly, yet he never said a word. He was led as a lamb to the
          slaughter. And as a sheep is silent before the shearers He did not
          open his mouth. From prison to trial, they led Him away to his death.

          that he was suffering for their punishment? He had done no wrong, and
          he never decieved anyone. But he was buried like a criminal: he was
          put in a rich man's grave". JN. 1:14: HEB. 4:15: ISA. 53:5,7-9 NLT.
